        Since I was little, I was curious about technologyâ€”how downloading
        pirated games made me feel like a hacker ðŸ˜‚, how taking apart my tablet
        at 10 years old ruined it, how subway systems predicted arrival times,
        and how a computer could give me access to everything just by using
        Google. These experiences pulled me into the world of technology and,
        little by little, into software development.

        Before becoming a programmer, I worked in various jobs: at a hotel, in a
        frozen fruit processing plant, cleaning heavy machinery, as a store
        cashier, and even as a store manager. Despite those jobs, I kept pushing
        forward in learning development. The journey is tough, but the view and
        the goal make it all worth it.
